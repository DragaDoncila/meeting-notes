Zulip, project communication, and governance (Juan)

- zulip looks good, but let's wait for more feedback on the image.sc zulip
  before publicising more broadly
- post link to scikit-image and scikit-learn governance docs
- Ahmet Can: stakeholders should agree on what this looks like

Open dialog, file IO, napari file #616, #379, #511, #604 (Nick)

- Minimal for now, add more options if people need them
- Path -> layer name

Text layer #600 (Kevin)

- 3D rendering an issue
- Juan to review

Interactive Scripting #650 (AhemtCan)

- pass arguments through
- name of convenience function
- speed of updating layer.data
- how to append to layer.data? dask.stack?

Invisible layer updates #578 (Nick, Juan)

- turn as much as possible off when visible=off

Labeled axes #644 (Nick)

- currently broken, but it can get there
- Talley and Nick to monitor

Gamma slider #610 merged (Talley)

Play button #607 (Talley)

- weird issues with test timing
- check whether 650 would help

Linter pre-commit hook #638 (Talley)

- Going in, should be minimal at first

Remote data / compute with dask (Nick)

- Nick -> link to toy example. Using dask sync primitives to synchronise viewer
  state between a shim remote viewer and a local viewer.
