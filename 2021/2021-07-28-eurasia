## Agenda

- informal discussion on packaging. 
    - Robert has had issues with PyOpenCL and made [napari-pyclesperanto-assistant suggest](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-pyclesperanto-assistant#installation) to download Christoph Golke's build via napari installer. That could be simplified. 
    - Grzegorz: use Windows specific dependency listing to depend on specific wheel for windows. Example: `dask ; sys_platform == 'linux'`
    - Robert has had issues with breaking conda environments and thus, worked on making his plugin installations work with pip only; actually via the napari-app only.
- Grzegorz: measurement plugin ported from PartSeg to a napari plugin! ðŸŽ‰
    - Can't make labels layer selection *non*optional... Which is weird?
    - Maybe raise issue in magicgui?
    - link: https://github.com/4DNucleome/PartSeg/tree/feature/napari_measurement_wigets (will be in next PartSeg release)
- Juan: reminder about napari plugin accelerator grants, deadline in ~40h! https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/napari-plugin-accelerator-grants/
- Juan: working groups.
    - Robert would like to join the bundled app working group.
- Short informal discussion about naming of operations `expand_labels`, `dilate_labels`, `erode_labels` and `shrink_labels`
- Alister: how to create a plugin that "activates" some behaviour (showing pixel values as text on top of image) but doesn't require any more interactivity
