## action items from last meeting

- Has Robert figured out how to distribute Roberts-Special-PyOpenCL-Formula Windows wheels for Windows only?
  - No, Robert hasn't. Robert ships a napari-app-bundle with a couple of plugins via USB thumb drive. 
- Working groups announcement: [in zulip](https://napari.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/212875-general/topic/working.20groups/near/248928995)
- Alister: how to create a plugin that "activates" some behaviour (showing pixel values as text on top of image) but doesn't require any more interactivity
    * Juan: I also ran into this this week. :face_palm: I think it will only be "nice" in the new plugin system. But my workaround is to add a one-button widget that adds the behaviour.
    * Robert: [Related feature request](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3015): Hook specs for executing a single thing once without GUI

## Agenda

- Introductions
- Juan: 3D fill, paint, erase, add points.
    - We discovered a bug in the "M" key callback on label layers (for setting the current label to n_labels + 1): When pressing it, there is an exception because the code should be `np.max(labels.data)` and not `labels.data.max()`.
    - Robert: Juan also nicely demonstrated [Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype/blob/master/demo/segmentation/voronoi_otsu_labeling.ipynb) in napari.
    - There is an issue with rendering of multiple 3D layers 
- Alister: interacting with 2D slices in 3D space & spotlight preview
- Robert: [Live-updating histograms](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-brightness-contrast) welcoming ideas for how to deal with big data
    - parallelize
    - [np.bincount](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.bincount.html)
    - precompute bins
    - [fast-histogram](https://github.com/astrofrog/fast-histogram)
- clipping planes https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/3140 (Lorenzo)!
