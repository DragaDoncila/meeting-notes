## Agenda

- Wiebke: micromanager/pycromanager/napari show & tell
- Alister: mini napari animation update, more things are now animate-able! (https://github.com/sofroniewn/napari-animation/pull/40)
- Draga: viewing + editing pydata/sparse arrays in napari
- Emil: maybe zarr with sparse blocks is actually fine
- Alister: could we conceivably use napari to explore 5D molecular dynamics data â€” Juan says yes! A "molecules" layer is not a priority but I would say not out of scope
- Alister: is there 2D, single-level tiled rendering? Yes, just merged! https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/2391
- Genevieve: would 2D tiled rendering resolve the labels layer painting problem? Juan: in theory yes but actually the labels layer does *not* inherit from the tiledimagelayer, so needs a bit of re-engineering so that it does. Should be doable.
