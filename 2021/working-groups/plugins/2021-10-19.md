<!-- Discussion goes here-->
https://github.com/tlambert03/npe2/issues/17

translation 
    should be stuff in zulip under plugin wg https://napari.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/296875-working-group-plugins/topic/meetings/near/251624587
    
    
    -  Add a extras' translatable=True to Pydantic models, and we should be able to extract all those fields.
    - Everything which is translation in the Python code can leverage the same kind of tooling napari uses.
        
        
    
versioning the manifest
Q: what does versioning cover
   A: one version id covering manifest format, and the contracts
Q: what to call the manifest/plugin api version field. and where

future compatibility - need to be able to reject unrecognized versions

backward compatibility - 

    - Old-Napari vs New Plugin: not a problem plugin can have a requirements napari>=X.y.z
    - New-Napari vs Old plugin: Npe2 can have arbitrary logic to convert old manifest to new ones, ignore them... 
    
    So I don't think we need a new field right now.

## Next steps
<!-- Action items go here -->

- remove `preview` from the manifest (it should be gleaned from `rc` in the version)
- probably remove `private` too.

- note about version number: remember that python version have epoch: `E!x.y.z`
