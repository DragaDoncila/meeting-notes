Eric - state of plugin developer docs
- what to do when I want to add a gui. many options? which one

Reader configuration
some of this has to do with fast evolution over time
- AICS non-lazy vs lazy loader

ImageJ import breaks w drag and drop - has to use defaults

How would you do a dynamic widget w MagicGui?
The layout is a mutable sequence, so you just append.
- https://napari.org/magicgui/usage/direct_api.html

The key is that magic gui decorator create instance, and factory create a class. 

There is some historical reasons to make JNI happy. Users could be just doing a subclass.


HOw to we get NPE2 in napri: 
  - let's to try import/except and have code in the main napari branch. 
  - Not on PyPI, and jsut leave that as manual install for now. 
  - Talley will turn the POC into a PR. 
      - Cleanup anf move to test-plugin
      - Figuring out where plugin can add menus where.
      - Tests.
  - Where are the plugins docs. 
      - Sphinx autodoc.

  - Maybe have extensions samples.
  - do we agree on the nameing `manifest.toml`? Yes.
  - 
### Expressions
Expressions:
- vscode when clause
    - napari issue #3350
    - context keys are the terminal symbols in the expressions
    - idea is napari would expose some 'isInViewer && isLayerActive'
    - plugins could define/maintain their own context keys
    
https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ is better for AST doc.


- like vs code, but Python syntax. 
- Shoudl manifest declare that plugin can define a context key.
    
- [ ] After the meeting add the minutes to the 'working-group/plugins' folder of [napari/meeting-notes](https://github.com/napari/meeting-notes).
