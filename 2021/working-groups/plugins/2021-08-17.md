## Last week


What should go in the manifest:
    What does nto have a parallel to VS Code:
    - The existing provides DockWidgets hooks. We can look at how VS code does the view. 
    - An example of plugins that is affinder.
    - Desired full name of the plugin (aka display name vs name & publisher where <publisher>.<name> will be a unique ID.)
      - How does that interract with package name (not the import name, we likely want the the name to mathc the PyPI name).
      
      https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0423/ forthe naming.
    
- Versions of things that we care about
    - Napari
    - Manifest file format/schema
    - Napari Plugin API version
    - The plugin version
<!-- Discussion goes here-->

## Next steps
<!-- Action items go here -->
- [ ] consider the possibility of a "plugin API version" that is independent of napari version *and* independent of the manifest schema and napari plugin engine.  This would handle something like the exact types that various functions expect/return.
- [ ] take a stab at writing a schema for reader/writer plugins, or widgets.

## Notes 
<!-- Other important details discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->

- [ ] After the meeting add the minutes to the 'working-group/plugins' folder of [napari/meeting-notes](https://github.com/napari/meeting-notes).
