<!-- Discussion goes here-->

- `napari_get_writer` currently returns a function.  does anything about npe2 allow us to skip straight to the "returned" function?


change the command "id" from `command` to `id`.


iter_compatible_writer : 

return a pair of commands and callable.
 
 
Manifest:
    - why is it "contributes" and not "contributions" ????
    
    
Write:
 - List of layers, 
 - Maybe an extension

When looking for writer plugin what shoudl we look for:
  - Subset fo layer types.
  - Or all of these types.
  - 
 
General question: How do we support streaming interfaces? Do plugin devs have to declare that they do/don't support streams in addition to paths?  Is this something that we do *for* them (i.e. convert between stream to tempfile) or do we provide examples on how to do it.

## Next steps
<!-- Action items go here -->
- [ ] Make an npe2 issue around api version declaration
## Notes 
<!-- Other important details discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->

- [ ] After the meeting add the minutes to the 'working-group/plugins' folder of [napari/meeting-notes](https://github.com/napari/meeting-notes).
