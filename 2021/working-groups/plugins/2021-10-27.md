Robert Hasse

- Menus
    - not stable ordering across systems in Plugins menu
    - Tools menu
        - command (how, plugin)
            - eg Remove Noise (Median, cupy)
            - Lesson learned already: name too long
        - separating lines ("Groups" in the napari proposal)
        - alphabetical ordering so stable order
    - command search plugin
        - Search for plugins that contain a certain name, hit Arrow Up/down to select, hit Enter to run. <- very popular among Fiji folks
        - hub integration, could search for commands from plugins that are not installed

- npe2 menus
    - no control over top level menus (napari defines top level)
    - seperators between categories of functionality (Protocol) in the menus, categories based on ontology
    - Q: [Matthias] if a plugin makes a submenu how does another plugin interact?
        - subgroups?
        - [Grzegorz] Some plugins have system dependencies, a kind of extenstion plugin, need plugins to be able to interact with each other's menus
            - [Talley] Context's may address some of these system/environment interactions
    - [Allister] would be nice to get a clear list of contribution categories
        - a process for adding new contribution kinds

- napari types to help define categories of plugin contributions
    - buy in without napari specific types
        - Variadic Generics
            - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0646/
    - https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3525

- Q: default menu placement vs explicit
    - [Matthias] prefer explicit and can back off of that later by adding behavior
        - simple first
    - [Alister] linting/tooling could suggest explicit menu placement
