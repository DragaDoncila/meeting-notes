<!-- Discussion goes here-->
TODO
  - Docs
      - Current docs are a bit confusing.
      - Somtime it it not clear core vs non core.
          - API consumed by napari, vs API for plugins developpers.
      - The hookspec make sens.
  - Migrate core plugins
      - https://github.com/napari/napari-svg
      - https://github.com/napari/napari-console
  - npe2/hub integration
      - human readable names
      - filters for plugin type
  - napari listing of available plugins
      - uses hub index
          - not critical at the moment
          - want more plugins
      - Distinguish information in manifest needed before and after install
      - Most of the information in manifest isn't necessary for listing

    - Napari language pack plugins
        - is there some value there  for providing translation (performance)
