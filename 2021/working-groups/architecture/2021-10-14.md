### Agenda

- Lorenzo: xarray
    - xarray gives us flexibility of representation
        - e.g. points could be sparsely or densely represented in time
    - no official support for units (yet)
    - dense dimensions can be chunked, which can often be efficient to query
    - can operate with dask (e.g. through memory map)
    - DataSet may help with some data wrangling
        - could we store properties in a DataArray separate from data?
        - or this about different grouping data sources? prob not
        - problems
    - slicing: selecting things by some bounding box
    - can non-coordinate dimensions have non-regular ordinate values (e.g. irregular time stamps)?
        - yes (i think)
        - this can also help with two different data arrays that have different sample lattices
    - if one dimension is irregular, then we need to add something like an ID column (e.g. for tracks right now)
    - if we want to guess which dimensions go where, does xarray help?
        - probably not
        - units could help though
- Andy: initial rough notes on layer/data model

### Action items

- Lorenzo: working on a prototype PR?
    - Implement points layer with a "dense" time dimension
    - How to go from Dims.slice to indices
- First step?
    - Use xarray without named slicing? I.e. see if we can support the current behavior/implementation while using xarray instead of numpy? 
    - Then next step may be to handle named dimensions?
