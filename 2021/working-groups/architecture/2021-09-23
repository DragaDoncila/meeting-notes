### Agenda

- Andy: added a second meeting on Tuesday at 23:00 UTC.
- Greg: extent of layers.
    - center of (0, 0) index pixel corresponds to (0, 0) world coordinate (assuming no translate/offset)
- Grzegorz: physical units (mm, um, s)
    - what to do with layers without units
    - possibly use pint as a dependency
    - need logic of how different dimensions/types are represented in the viewer
        - Similar to layer axis labels
        - https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1904
- Andy: some updates on textmanager PR, and feedback from Juan.

Dimensions and axes
- names/symantic names at layer level
    - view cares about specific ones
- categories of dimensions
    - space dims are vis by default
    - time mapped to a slider by default
    - color/channels get to handled as color by default
- scales
    - "world space" physical units
        - transforms: layer -> world -> view
        - might be used to defn fixed steps
            - import a 0.5 µm/px and 1 µm/px, what happens when you step in z?

Origin of pixels and scale
- one choice is to make it scale invariant
    - imagine importing image layers w different scales
- but what happens when you add a point/label to a pixel, it
    should get centered on the pixel naturally?
- what about shapes etc

### Action items

- Grzegorz: add some relevant examples to issue [#906](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/906), and mention related work.
- Andy/Nathan: consider starting/reassigning work related to axis labels.
