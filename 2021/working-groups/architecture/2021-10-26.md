### Agenda

- Andy: final touches on https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/3493
    - Settled on general approach, API, and current implementation.
    - Naming
        - What should Direct mean?
        - Go through all public names and verify them.
    - colormap field:
        - Can both nominal and quant color encodings have a colormap field of different types?
            - Need to try making a real validator for Colormap (ensure_colormap often warns as a safe fallback, which is undesirable here)
            - Literal/const may help to disambiguate.
    - do we want colormap fields to have defaults?
        - if so, we prob need the literal/const field to disambiguate
        - do we want to automatically infer the type from the properties table (i.e. if i just pass a property name, what should happen?)
    - indices: what type should this be?
        - list would be easiest as it is Sized and can be used to slice numpy arrays, but any other ideas would be good (can we drop usage of set as in existing tests of remove?)
    - should we do some refactoring of the property table first, to make some things easier?
        - e.g. if we had n_rows then we could support deprecated behavior more easily (and may not even need to deprecate TextManager.values) and reduce argument counts
- Greg: corner pixels PR
