    - Retro on what's been done so far
    - Goal: work out what we need to next
- [Nathan] slicing
    - Takes instance of `Dims` as an input
    - How to map output dimensions to input dimensions after slicing
        - Can we store this mapping?
            - As a transform?
        - Will xarray help here? Probably
        - Why do we want this? Back projection from viewer state to sub-volume in input data.
        - Sampling might be a problem?
- [Ahmet] general/viewer related API
    - Ability to get Viewer widget independently of the MainWindow that napari/qt creates.
    - Ability to use ViewerModel independently?
    - Need to define more specific issue
