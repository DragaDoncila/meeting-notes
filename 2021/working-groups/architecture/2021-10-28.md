### Agenda

- Out-of-process control https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3553
    - e.g. napari-micromanager
        - napari is the main process
        - hardware control occurs on subprocesses
    - Qt and OpenGL context are main problems when it comes to using non-main thread
    - communicating generating layers
        - save and then use shared file system
        - streaming layers?
            - https://github.com/jacopoabramo/napari-live-recording
- Viewer/Application state serialization https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1286
    - marshalling of layers/plugins is a problem
        - plugin versions/state
        - magicgui makes this a lot simpler
    - fight with globals at the moment is mainly in the tests
        - e.g. global still lives but qt object is deleted somehow
    - what about generated layers

- Table view https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3512
    - Nice statement of desired features https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3512#issuecomment-950645888
    - Magicgui vs qt: looks like concensus is qt
