### Agenda

- Andy: properties PR
	- Benchmark PR.
	    - Any other key usage to consider?
	- Should we consider an API more like `encoding.get_array(properties, indices) -> np.ndarray`?
	    - This is ultimately the API we use internally (i.e. that our vispy/layer calls).
	    - It also naturally supports an implementation with caching, and would not require us to update values as they are added.
	    - Can we leave this as a potential future contribution? Should we hide the currently proposed API?
	    - @jni says: ultimately encoding will happen on the pre-sliced object, once we figure out slicing
	- Should we guess the type (discrete, continuous) of property when given a property name as str?
		- Currently, we recognize this as IdentityEncoding, which is fine for strings, but maybe not fine for colors.
		- If we do this, we'd need to define some default color cycles for discrete colors.
	- Update vs. reassignment of TextManager?
        - Related to discussion around text events.
        - Update can be done, though a little awkward. Kind of weird that setter does not actually do reassignment, but we can make update effectively act like it does.

### Action items

- Andy: add comments around weirdly behaving tests, skip -> xfail
- Andy: string encoding PR: hide some methods, deprecate appropriately
- Juan: review/approve #3452
