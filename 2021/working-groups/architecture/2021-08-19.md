# Napari: architecture working group notes

## 2021/08/19

### Agenda

- Andy (30 min): high level overview of properties refactor ideas: https://hackmd.io/xZLH2OFAR42xU1f0e5nboQ?view#Ideas


### Notes

#### Attendees

- Andy Sweet
- Nathan Clack
- Jordao Bragantini
- Alister Burt
- Grzegorz Bokota
- Tally Lambert

#### Properties refactor proposal

See proposal for design goals/open questions.

##### PropertyTable/Column

- PropertyColumn encapsulates property values, choices, default/current value.
- PropertyTable as Dict[str,PropertyColumn] w a defined interface

contrast w pandas
 - series
 - categoricals

- Rather than choices uses types, constrained types via pydantic
    - column could have a type field and a set_type method
    - might help plugins work together
- Should add explicit default

- pandas 
    - can be awkward when it comes to nullable/optional types
        - coerces to NaN
    - still needs some concept of default value

- maybe current color should live in labels control and that should be queried

##### PropertyMap: Functional style attributes

- classes vs lambdas
    - for serialization and type signature
    - more explicit declaration related state

- default values?

- Support direct style mapping
    - how to override values derived from properties

- Key: per-data properties not a general metadata model

##### Questions/Ideas

- How to enforce constraint that layers have access to consistent style properties?

- Encapsulate styles?
    - map an object (corresponding to a row in the properties) to a Style
    - gui manipulates a default Style object

- Maybe style columns are marked as special
    - private 

- what's the separation between properties and data
- styling based on (x,y,z), intensity?
    - how to do under the hood?

- Track styling
    - points, edges, interp 
    - track layer has a nice api

### Action items

- [ ] explore pydantic for typing columns (esp around pydantic)


- Tracks are an interesting case
    - [ ] need to be able to edit tracks. create an issue.
        - Fiji has one of the only ways to edit tracks
        
- Andy: start writing up some initial tasks
    - There will likely be open questions and implementation details still to work out for each task.
    - But at this point, it makes sense to start getting some PRs up for review.
