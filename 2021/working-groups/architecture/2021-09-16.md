### Agenda

- Layer data/slicing starting points
    - what does slicing mean?
        - accessing sub-volume of an nD dataset
            - need to keep track of dims and also handle transforms from axis-aligned indices to sub-volume view
        - example usage: some biologists want to see an internal slice in a 3D volume
    - at a high level: how to separate layer, data, dims
    - related to lorenzos/alistair's arbitrary clipping planes
    - want to access different sub-volumes of same data (e.g. multi-view/canvas)
    - two issues that may be blockers/related
        - issue: 1353 (layer models): https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1353
        - need to clarify what has been done: follow-up with a core dev
- Vispy multi-view/canvas problems
    - datoviz: maybe an alternate Vulkan-based backend for vispy at some point?
        - https://cyrille.rossant.net/datoviz/
    - previous work: multiple view boxes?
    - could upload 3D texture to GPU, then take 2D texture slices from that. Alternatively slice 2D textures on CPU (usually fine for small textures).
    - vispy scenecanvas (concerned with swapping, vsync)
- Review WIP layer properties PR


### Action items

- Andy: push updates to WIP PR, with second call for feedback
- Andy: get property table PR ready to be merged in main
