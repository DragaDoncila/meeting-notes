### Agenda

- Performance issue PR: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/1950
    - Core issue is that we want a safe/future-proof way of udpating `Layer._extent_cache`, and connecting to `Layer.events` is the convenient way of doing this, but is discouraged.
    - Some ideas around alternative fixes.
        - Change `extent` property to `get_extent` method to make it more clear that some heavy computation could be occurring (and users may want to store the result if used more than once).
            - This doesn't actually solve the performance problems here, but could help prevent future ones.
        - Add a method to `LayerList` and/or `ViewerModel` that adds multiple layers at a time.
            - This avoids the specific performance problem described here, but not some of the related ones.
            - How common is this use case?
        - Cache `LayerList.extent` instead of `Layer.extent`
            - The main problem here is that there is even more state to check to see if we should update the cache (all the extent related data of all the layers).
        - Cache some of the state in the transforms (e.g. `TransformChain`).
            - There's less state to worry about here, but some of it is externally mutable, which makes caching difficult (e.g. doing something like checking the values of the matrix is not much faster than just doing the multiply)
