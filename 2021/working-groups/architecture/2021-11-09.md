### Agenda

- Nathan: Dependency injection vs globals ([#3564](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3564))
    - General feeling is that DI is fine as a simple pattern, but that we should avoid any DI frameworks until we start using that pattern and find the associated boilerplate to impact readability (and understandability of lifetimes/scopes)
- Eric: Quick recap of initial async meeting ([rough notes](https://hackmd.io/M7xL_sGkQRG9X7LLcY7jiA)).
    - Next time?
