### Agenda

- [Andy]: incremental vs. lazy encodings
    - can we support incremental approach with protected methods to match current behavior, then move to lazy later?
- [Eric]: slicing inferno
    - quick update
    - slice/view is a way of reducing number of dims from layer to viewer dims
    - what does it mean to view 2D layer in 3D?
    - what does it mean to view multiple layers with different dims?
    - napari kind of handles this well already
- [Ahmet Can]: needs for acquisition/control project
    - strong desire to separate slice state from layer
    - what kind of data?
        - last frame buffer from an acq stream (may be enough init)
        - stream data to disk, then read those later if/when needed (some existing examples that do this)
    - need to define data source
        - this could be dynamic, like a stream from a camera/microscope
- [Andy]: Napari ~~Enhancement~~ Acceleration Proposal (NAPs)
    - PR adding SKIPs to scikit-image: https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3585
    - Use numpy or skimage (or something else?) as a direct template.
        - Maybe adjust some things around process.
    - Only do this for big projects
        - Where there is some way to determine what big means (e.g. steering council decision, voting, breaking changes, new large dependency etc.)
        - Don't want to add process for smaller projects
    - Understand where this might break and if we want to do anything to handle that


### Action items

- [Andy]: PR for bringing in pandas DataFrame for Layer.features
    - Maybe take a NAP
