# napari documentation working group

## 2021-09-16

### Last week's action items
- [x] Set up meeting invite & put on the napari calendar & advertise it on the zulip (Justin)
- [x] Check in with Alister & any other euro folks (Gen) DONE: messaged Alister on zulip
- [x] (Documentation for the documenters) Ask about how the napari/docs are rendered (Melissa will ask Kira or Jeremy)
- [x] Set up Github project on napari.org (Gen) DONE: [Documentaion working group GitHub project](https://github.com/napari/napari.github.io/projects/1)
- [x] Start thinking about what the docs deployment pipeline looks like (Justin)
- [x] Start thinking about user stories for napari (Chi-Li, Draga, everyone) Link to user stories doc: https://hackmd.io/eQmZcF1pQauBYtB5xf8QZw
- [x] Contributor documentation standards draft (Draga)
- [ ] Pull request template, add checkbox for documentation (Draga)

### Agenda
- current state of the docs (Melissa)
  - should we have docs mirrored in two places? We want the functionality of selecting the docs for a specific version of napari (the napari API especially changes between versions)
  - the scikit-image API docs might be a good model https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/ 
- docs staging site (Justin) 
  - Takeaway: contributors should be able to contribute frequently, separate from the infrastructure cadence
- contributor standards guide (Draga)
  - Draga's [initial thoughts are here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-dZ4BWVN9Bmk49qxu1_8ed4YhDWkuhmWGN4tMGCHTQ0/edit#heading=h.ow6y2d7aow17).
- organisation: where do the tutorials/examples/main code live?
There are several advantages if tutorials are separate from main code:
1. You can have more complicated dependencies and more complicated tutorials 
2. You can have binder pointing to all the tutorials repo
3. We don't have time pressure on solving the auto-generation of gifs/movies

- user stories: [document here](https://hackmd.io/eQmZcF1pQauBYtB5xf8QZw?view)
  - for new users, jupyter notebooks are the most useful tool

### Next week's action items

- [ ] early next week, post invite to general zulip stream (Justin)
- [ ] Ask Juan to advertise the documentation working group to the European crowd at the next Australia/Europe napari meeting (Gen)
- [ ] For all the user stories, make notes on what the "solution" is. Are there any gaps we need to fix? (Chi-Li)

### User stories (so far)

*“As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”*

Personas:
- new user (with or without python knowledge)
- intermediate/advanced user
- new contributor
- new plugin developer
- expert contributor

* New plugin developer: 
    * As a computational biologist, I want to build a plugin (but also first to know if similar plugins already exist to save development time), so that I can analyze the image data provided by biologists. I'm given data format X and analysis goal Y.
    * As a developer, I have some existing scripts in Python that I want to integrate into Napari, so that I can take advantage of its viewer capability.
    * As a developer without much Python packaging experience, I want to know all the steps involved in creating and publishing my plugin to the napari hub

* New user:
    * As a researcher, I want to know what Napari can do, so that I can decide if this will help with the project and worth spending the time learning.
    * As a new user, I want to be able to install napari easily and display an image.
    * As a researcher, I want to perform similar analysis workflow I saw published on a paper/presented in a conference using Napari, so that I can get the same result for my own data.
    * As a new user without any Python experience I want to find out how to perform analysis tasks without having to write any code
    * As a new user I want to know the purpose of the different layers in napari, what they're best suited for, and how they differ from each other
    
* Intermediate/advanced user:
    *  As an advanced user I want to easily find what properties and methods are available to me for manipulating the viewer
    *  As an advanced user I want to know the options for and limitations of using napari in a non-standard environment e.g. remotely, in a docker container, on a portable device(?), etc.
    *  As an intermediate/advanced user, I want to know what changes have been made in napari since the last release and how any new features can be used

* New contributor:
    *  As a new contributor I want it to be clear if/to what extent my contributions are welcome to different parts of the codebase, the contribution workflow, and the expectations for my PRs
    *  As a new contributor I want to know what communication channels are available (and preferred) for discussing contributions/ideas with the community and the development team
