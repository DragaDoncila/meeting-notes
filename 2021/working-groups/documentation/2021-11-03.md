### Last week's action items

- [ ] Justin to schedule design bugs time into a sprint sometime in December/January
- [ ] Gen should review some of Draga's PRs for content
- [ ] Melissa (really for week of 8th/9th November) Reorganization PRs. Melissa will check with Jeremy & Kira, etc. about how often docs build.
- [ ] Melissa (really for week of 8th/9th November) to think about how to expose or integrate napari/examples data on the website (and possibly if there's a better way to integrate workshop content, eg: Nick's NEUBIAS notebooks)
- [ ] [name=melissa] Create a plan with PR merging strategy for reorganization of docs
    - Partly done. [Some notes here](https://hackmd.io/@melissawm/HJArEXPIY)
- [name=Draga] make draft PR with proposed changes and updated contributors' docs together in napari.github.io so it can be previewed


### Agenda
- Welcome Tom, and discussion about the goals of the group and the "charter"
    - We will need to fill this out once [3558](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/3558) is merged
- [ ] [name=Draga] Finalise what documents we want for documentation contributors and what the "narrative" should be
    - Decision was to keep tutorial and how-to templates separate and make overview contributor's guide the landing page of the Documentation section/subsection.
    - Keep the jupytext guide and "git-free" PR guide in the documentation subsection rather than in general 'how-tos'/'tutorials' because their scope is too narrow
    - Crosslink among these four documents and back to the landing page to ground the user
    - Draga to make draft PR with proposed changes and updated docs together in napari.github.io so it can be previewed


### Next week's action items
- [ ] [name=Draga] Discuss preferred workflow for contributors to preview their documents before submission
- [ ] [name=Draga] Download and/or GitHub JupyterBook buttons
