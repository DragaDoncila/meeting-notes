### Agenda

* Draga has written a draft template about how to contribute documentation (based on the numpy contributing docs), will share as a PR
* Update on the new napari theme - it's almost ready to use. QA testing first.
* Coming up soon, we need a prioritization session (maybe involving the steering council as well). Might plan this for late October.
* napari bug bash - Chi-Li says we should also check for out-of-date content & new features not highlighted in the documentation. We should audit the documentation for this too (especially the layer tutorials).
* How to make napari workshop materials available/visible to people from the napari docs website - https://github.com/napari/napari.github.io/issues/135
    * Software carpentry have master tutorial materials & also make available the materials from each individual tutorial
* Glossary https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3231 - Sphinx has support for this. First step: get the list of terms to include (eg: image channel, in geospatial is equivalent as a band). 
    * Example glossary w/ sphinx: [starfish glossary](https://spacetx-starfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/help_and_reference/glossary/glossary.html) 
    * [EDAM Bioimaging Ontology](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/EDAM-BIOIMAGING?p=classes)
* Newbie image analysis page
    * We should link to https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/user_guide/numpy_images.html
    * Draga has a nice explanation for why axes are tzyx & stored like that in memory. This explanation is better than a 2D example x/y row/column example, which is confusing for new people. **We should also link to the xarray library here**

### Next week's action items

- [ ] Open PR for template on contributing how-to documentation (Draga)
- [ ] Open a separate PR for reformattin existing how-to-guides to the new format (Draga)
- [ ] Make PR for https://github.com/napari/napari.github.io/issues/135. Also ask Mel where we should put it, and if we have a better idea than just a webpage that links to all these things (Gen)
- [ ] Ask Robert Haase for his glossary list, update comments in https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3231 (Chi-Li)
