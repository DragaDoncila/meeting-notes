# Documentation Working Group

This folder contains meeting notes for the Documentation Working Group


The napari documentation working group's mission is to ensure that all napari users have a place to easily find the information necessary to meet their goals with napari. We want to ensure that the napari community has the infrastructure needed to contribute reproducible documentation.

Team priorities:
- Content & organisation or napari.org
- Users must have a clear path through the documentation (currently lacking)
- Easy for people to contribute to and keep updated
