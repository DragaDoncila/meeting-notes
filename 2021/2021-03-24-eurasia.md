## Agenda

- kevin/Alister shader slicing demo
    - Lorenzo: can this be used to help multi-canvas? not immediately
    - https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/2226 linking layers: might give nice cross-viewer sync?
- Robert: [Bio-image Analysis course with python (and napari)](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Bio-image_Analysis_with_Python)
    - Feedback + links to other good resources for beginners welcome!
- napari update version: might break plugins. Should we encourage plugins to add an upper pin on their compatible. See: https://github.com/napari/product-heuristics-2020/issues/4;
    - idea: test plugins for compatibility, since napari knows about all the plugins
    - napari should allow backing up to previous version
    - Robert: Fiji has similar issues. [Communication is key](https://analyticalscience.wiley.com/do/10.1002/was.0004000112)

Notes
-----
Daylight savings changes: we think we'll keep this meeting at the same time in CET. There was a discussion about shifting it one hour later in CET (so UK people don't have an 8am meeting), but that would mean at least one person (Gregorz) could not attend.
