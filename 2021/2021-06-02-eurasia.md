## Agenda

- Juan: live Unet blockwise processing + watershed (https://github.com/jni/platelet-unet-watershed)
  * currently very use-case specific but could be made generic!
- Discussion: properties filters for labels editing
- Draga (if time): demo computing function at point coordinates widget (from Dask Summit)
- Grzegorz: imagecodecs build issue
- Alister: how to insert napari into a workflow tool while controlling things like layout etc?
    - Plugin hookspec for command-line arguments?
    - Have the plugin itself modify the layout? `napari --with my-awesome-layout` (invisible widget that takes the viewer and messes with the layout)
    - napari commandline/viewer options for layout? (`show_layerlist=False`)
