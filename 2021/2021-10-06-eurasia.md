## Agenda

- Brief discussion about 
    - https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3343#issuecomment-923888197
    - vispy OIT: https://github.com/vispy/vispy/pull/2039
- Grzegorz: permanent storage for plugins
    - e.g. json + objects providing custom serialisation and deserialisation.
    - plugins can implement save config/load config for now
    - napari could e.g. for functional plugins automatically save parameters for functional plugins between runs.
    - napari plugin infrastructure could allow saving parameter sets as "profiles"
- Juan: related issue of sharing state between widgets.
    - Different plugins might want to access the saved state dict of other plugins. But this presents stability challenges.
- Grzegorz: protocols e.g. register thresholding functions
    - Robert: napari-pyclesperanto-prototype offers this now and wants to extend to be cross-library. There is a [proof-of-principle PR draft available](https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant/pull/19)
- Robert: Allen Cell Segmenter has data processing flows "on steroids": workflows get saved as "human readable" JSON files, including English description of the steps :tada:  [see youtube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm58uRQs3Lo) by Jianxu Chen [who just moved to Germany and became group](https://www.isas.de/en/news/new-ambiom-group-jianxu-chen-wants-to-develop-eyes-and-brains)
- Robert: Lorenzo wrote about accessing GPU buffers directly, can he expand on that
  - Lorenzo: https://github.com/cupy/cupy/issues/5711
  - vispy work to improve patching/subclassing: https://github.com/vispy/vispy/pull/2227
  - Juan: DLPack for compatibility between libraries [see issue on clesperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype/issues/98)
