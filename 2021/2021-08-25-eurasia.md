Notes
-----
- people are excited about 0.4.11
- Hanjin presented impy, amazing!!
- Robert, reuse of napari plugins, "community plugin"
    - Suggestion: found a git-hub organization to collect plugins of common use
    - Goal: Share maintenance work, make plugins less "single-developer" driven
    - Good for commonly used general purpose plugins, maybe not so good for (PhD-) project specific stuff
    - Discussion necessary of how to setup community rules / code of conduct before founding such an organization
    - Check out how other organizations deal with that
- Don't connect events to partials/lambdas!!!
