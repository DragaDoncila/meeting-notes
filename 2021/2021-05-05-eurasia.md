## action items from last meeting

Robert probably still looking for feedback:
- Robert: [Bio-image Analysis course with python (and napari)](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Bio-image_Analysis_with_Python)
    - Feedback + links to other good resources for beginners welcome!


## Agenda

- Draga: progressbar, um, progress (we can't make this joke every time we talk about progress bars...)
    - Also feedback on whether we'd want to patch tqdm
    - we would not :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 
    - or maybe only temporarily, the same way that we temporarily set the dask.optimize.fuse config
- (maybe) Juan: displaying skeletons in napari using labels layer (joint work with Kevin Yamauchi)
- Grzegorz: Tooltip for labels and points https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/2658, https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/2657
