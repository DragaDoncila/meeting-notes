# Napari developer meetings

## 2021-11-11

It's veteran's day in the USA, so there are a lot fewer people attending than usual.

### This week Agenda

- Should we have synthetic data to test the napari tutorials in a way that's less heavy than the real data?
  - Could do lazy generation of synthetic data using scikit-image blobs function 
  - Github actions cache will stora 5GB for 7 days, so if we run something once 
  - Talley's dask/napari tutorial is an outlier. Almost all the other tutorials can work with small data ~3GB total. However, Talley's tutorial is a very important one, the google site analytics suggest many many people are visiting this particular page
    - Talley's dask/napari tutorial might need to be adapted to not use CUDA anymore
- Discussed documentation structure
  - comparison to VisPy and Dask docs (Dask docs have been recently reorganized, seems like that's improved page loading times)
