### Agenda
- Lorenzo: Molecular Visualization
    chimerax blog post with details, possible followup after Nick discusses with Tom Goddard
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5734306/
    standard nd molecular pythonic object? (Jaime says it doesn't exist :( ))
    - Jaime adds:
        - In my experience, best molecular structure reader is MDAnalysis, with ParmED and RDKit (this one for small molecules / cheminformatics) if needed.
        - OMSF is working towards standardizing molecular formats: https://omsf.io/
        - Letters in atom numbers is called Hybrid-36, not really part of the standard; e.g. https://github.com/openmm/openmm/issues/659 & https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/1897
        - ChimeraX's tricks are summarized somehow in their paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5734306/ and https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pro.3943
    
- Nathan: napari-svg manifest and writer questions
  https://github.com/napari/napari-svg/pull/21
- Ilja: quick summary of what I've been doing
    - using napari as a general purpose array viewer
    - recently discovered plugins/the community!
- Robert: [napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes); basically a follow up on [an image.sc discussion](https://forum.image.sc/t/segmenting-cells-from-membrane-channels-and-nuclei-as-seeds-seeded-watershed/55670)

- Alister: napari was mentioned briefly on the talkpython podcast during a discussion with Matthew Rocklin on dask, should we reach out for a potential discussion about napari?
    - yes from all, email has since been sent without response
