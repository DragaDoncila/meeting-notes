## previous meeting notes

Robert probably still looking for feedback:
- Robert: [Bio-image Analysis course with python (and napari)](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Bio-image_Analysis_with_Python)
    - Feedback + links to other good resources for beginners welcome!


## Agenda

- Juan/Abi: affinity watershed animation
- Kevin: feedback on layer property browser (@jni says: ooooh! =P). Repo here:https://github.com/kevinyamauchi/napari-properties-viewer (currently workin on the `bidirectional-comm` branch)
    - Should we somehow display what the properties are linked to (e.g., text, face/edge color). Yes, investigate.
    - Should we allow cells to be colored (either background or swatch in cell) by property value (i.e., apply cmap)? Sounds interesting, but not a high priority feature.
    - When an element is selected in the table, should it be selected in the viewer? Yes, definitely.
    - Should we also have a simple scatter plot view (i.e., select a property for each axis and make scatter plot)? Yes, maybe start with pyqtgraph
- Robert: Will pyopencl merge Juans PR because of a bug report in napari? https://github.com/inducer/pyopencl/pull/301
    - If so, might that mean significant speedup for the [napari-pyclesperanto-assistant](https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant)?
    - points.data should be the input data
- Grzegorz: translation worries
    - points: localization of macros + other UI in Excel uniformly hated by attendees
    - localization should be settable within napari preferences, not always using system settings

Notes
-----

Multiscale Opening (as alternative to afinite watershed): Article https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7332764 (Techincal detailed description) implemented here https://github.com/4DNucleome/PartSegCore-compiled-backend/tree/master/src/PartSegCore_compiled_backend/multiscale_opening. Short description inside https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-021-03984-1#Sec2 > Roi Extraction. It could be selected in PartSeg using one of Flow Algortithm (Grzegorz)
