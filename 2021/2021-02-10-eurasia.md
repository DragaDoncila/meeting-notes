# napari eurasia meeting 2021-02-10

## Agenda

- introductions!
- Juan/Jonas: affinder update: improvements, layer groups discussion, napping features
- Alister: mixed 2D/3D rendering API/interactivity discussion ([#839](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/839))
  * Volker/Robert: should be done in the shader
  * Grzegorz: Add context menu to layers
  * Alister: how to get a vec3 data into the shader? Can napari provide an API for this?
  * All this stuff could open the door to arbitrary cut planes for in-GPU data

- tracing: check whether Robert is being held up by GPU->CPU->GPU. Tracing docs: https://napari.org/docs/dev/guides/perfmon.html
  * Looks like da.stack might be the culprit, though
