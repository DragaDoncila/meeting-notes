# napari eurasia meeting 2021-01-27

## Agenda

- introductions!
- Juan: affinder update: improvements, and plugin architecture discussion
- Kevin: plugin questions
    - Is there a way to delete an instance of a plugin widget (I think the x just hides the widget)?
    - I think it could be useful if there was a way that plugins could substitute their own layer controls for the default napari ones. I think there a lot of scenarios where the default controls allow the user to enter undesirable states for a plugin. Thoughts?
- Robert: Crop-plugin. Cool to limit computation on a region. However, some drag&drop interactivity for specifying the bounding-box would be cool and I'd love to hear hints/tips/tricks if something similar has been implemented already...

    response from Alister: I know of a good MATLAB implementation of this (ew matlab!), can show you tomorrow if you like!
    - Kevin: this would be super useful for me!

- Kevin: labeling large volumes (if time, not super urgent)
- (insert other items here!)
- Open discussion + Q&A


Notes
-----

- idea: hookspec to define "plugin sets" that work together; these would just be the names of the plugins to activate.
- Alister's MATLAB demo software: https://wiki.dynamo.biozentrum.unibas.ch/w/index.php/Downloads
