# Napari developer meetings

## 2020-02-20

### Items from last meeting

- None

### Agenda

1. Janelia image acquisition meeting update (Nick)
    - Summary: micromanager people will pull out the C++ driver layer to be independent, could live on PyPI
    - second phase: update the C++ API to something that is usable by both Python and Java folks
3. Reader plugins update [#937] (Talley)
    - Main issue: getting pluggy to return the identity of the plugin which provided a function. Small PR (to be) submitted to pluggy.
5. magicgui update (Talley)
    - pre-alpha, so not yet hard napari dependency, but could envision that for the future
7. Website update [#764] (Kira)
8. Physical Coordinates / transforms [#763], [#885] (Juan)
9. quick question about complex dtype.
    - do we want `_raw_to_displayed` after we fix labels? We all agreed this was not ideal but not a blocker.
10. labels PR: Nick will possibly take over next week!


### Action items

- Talley will try to wrap up complex numbers before going off-grid for a bit to prepare for QI CSHL course in late March
